Unified Web 3D Client
=====================

Introduction and Overview
-------------------------

The Unified Web 3D Client is a component for your website to display OGC query language accessible as WebGL 3D objects without requiring the user to install addons or plugins (as long as the browser supports WebGL).

This document is to help you understand how to install, configure and run the 3D client in your website.

NOTE: documentation currently in early state

Besides this introduction, the Unified Web 3D Client project comes with example files and a reference that is auto-generated from its heavily commented sourcecode. You can find the reference documentation under ./docs.
